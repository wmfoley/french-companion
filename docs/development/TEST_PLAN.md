# Test and Acceptance Plan — v0.1

## FC-001
1. Web preview launches without exceptions.
2. Pure JS grader accepts `crise` when expected `crise`.
3. Grader rejects `crize` and identifies incorrect spelling.
4. Accent-sensitive case: expected `négociateur`, input `negociateur` is not fully correct.
5. No child names, secrets, AI requests, or Supabase calls are present.
6. Lint and unit test commands complete successfully; report actual output.
7. Sample grader ignores case and surrounding whitespace, preserves accents/internal whitespace/punctuation, and treats canonically equivalent Unicode strings as equal. Preserve the original response.
8. Home -> practice -> home works in the live web preview, with no runtime exceptions or console errors; report headless and human visual verification separately.

## Educational POC acceptance
- Teacher-provided vocabulary and definitions preserved exactly after review.
- `patient` -> `patiemment`; `patiament` rejected.
- Error spotting has one clear wrong spelling in single-answer mode.
- Dictation answer hidden until submitted; replay available on supported device.
- Mixed practice uses at least three question types.
- Child sees French-first guidance; parent receives accurate English explanation.
- Source and supplementary content are visually distinguishable.
- Incorrect answers can be revisited; no AI call needed for repeated sessions.

## Human validation
Parent checks source transcription and answer keys. Observe whether a Grade 4 child can complete a short session independently; note confusing interactions without storing identifying details. Do not treat one household's experience as market validation.
